# To-Do List App in React JS

## Overview

This project is part of the Codevixens Frontend Development Challenge (Day 7). A simple to-do list application built using React. It demonstrates how to manage state, handle events, and render lists dynamically.

## Features

- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the input value, the list of to-do items, and the status of each item.
- **Event Handling**: Handles the button click event to add new to-do items, and events for marking items as completed, editing items, and deleting items.
- **List Rendering**: Dynamically renders the list of to-do items using the `map` function.
- **User Interface**: Provides a form for adding new to-do items, a list to display the items, and buttons for marking items as completed and deleting them.
- **Styling**: Uses CSS to style the application for a visually appealing look.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gideonagyage/To-Do-List-App.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd To-Do-List-App
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to

```bash
http://localhost:3000.
```

## How it Works

The `TodoListApp` component is the main component that handles the following:

1. **Input Handling**: Manages the user's input for new to-do items.
2. **State Updates**: Updates the state with the new to-do item, the status of each item, and the list of items.
3. **Event Handling**: Handles the button click event to add new to-do items, and events for marking items as completed and deleting items.
4. **List Rendering**: Renders the list of to-do items dynamically using the `map` function.
5. **UI Rendering**: Renders the input field, button, to-do list, and buttons for marking items as completed and deleting them.
